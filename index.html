    <h4>My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
        when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.</h4>
